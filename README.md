# RAFTLiTE

RAFTLiTE is a light weight implementation of the RAFT protocol. The code in this repository is based on ideas/code found in [simpleraft](https://github.com/streed/simpleRaft).

[simpleraft](https://github.com/streed/simpleRaft) provides an excellent basic framework to construct RAFT based applications. But, requires additional work to serve clients, perform node discovery etc.... RAFTLiTE takes a shot at incorporating these features.

More Documentation soon to come!
